Cadova is a Swift library for creating 3D models through code, with a focus on 3D printing. It offers a programmable alternative to traditional CAD tools, combining precise geometry with the expressiveness and elegance of Swift.

Cadova models are written entirely in Swift, making them easy to version, reuse, and extend. The result is a flexible and maintainable approach to modeling, especially for those already comfortable with code.

Cadova runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux. To get started, read the [Getting Started guide](https://github.com/tomasf/Cadova/wiki/Getting-Started).
