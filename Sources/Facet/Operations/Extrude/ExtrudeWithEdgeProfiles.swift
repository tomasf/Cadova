    /// The method of extrusion can be selected based on the desired characteristics
    /// of the resulting shape.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - height: The height of the extrusion.
    ///   - topEdge: The profile of the top edge.
    ///   - bottomEdge: The profile of the bottom edge.
    ///   - method: The method of extrusion, either `.layered(thickness:)` or `.convexHull`.
    ///     - `.layered`: This method divides the extrusion into distinct layers with a given thickness. While less elegant and more expensive to render, it is suitable for non-convex shapes. Layers work well for 3D printing, as the printing process inherently occurs in layers.
    ///     - `.convexHull`: This method creates a smooth, non-layered shape. It is often computationally less intensive and results in a more aesthetically pleasing form but only works as expected for convex shapes.
    /// - Returns: The extruded 3D geometry.
