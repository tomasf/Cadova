## Overview

Cadova is a Swift library for constructing 3D models programmatically — with a focus on 3D printing. It builds on the ideas of OpenSCAD, but replaces its limited language with the power and elegance of Swift. Inspired by SwiftUI and designed for developers who want a better way to build models through code, Cadova is cross-platform and works on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
