public extension Geometry {
    /// Applies a transformation only to the parts of a geometry that intersect a specified mask.
    ///
    /// This method removes the masked area from the original geometry, applies a transformation to the full geometry,
    /// then intersects the result with the mask, and finally adds the transformed result back into the shape.
    /// It's useful for selectively applying modifications such as rounding, offsetting, or translation.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - mask: A closure that returns the mask geometry. The transformation will only be applied within this region.
    ///   - operations: A closure that takes the *original geometry* and returns a modified version, to be restricted to the mask area.
    /// - Returns: A new geometry where the specified transformation is applied only inside the masked region.
    ///
    /// ## Example
    /// Round only one point of a five-pointed star:
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// Circle(diameter: 5)
    ///     .convexHull(adding: [10, 0])
    ///     .repeated(count: 5)
    ///     .whileMasked {
    ///         Rectangle(10)
    ///             .aligned(at: .centerY)
    ///             .translated(x: 2.5)
    ///     } do: {
    ///         $0.rounded(outsideRadius: 0.5)
    ///     }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// In this example, a vertical rectangle defines a mask over one of the starâ€™s points.
    /// The `rounded` operation is applied only within that region. All other points remain sharp.
    ///
