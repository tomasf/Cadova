    /// Sweeps the 2D geometry along a helical path around the Z axis, creating a 3D spiral shape.
    ///
    /// This method sweeps the 2D shape upward while wrapping it around the Z axis:
    /// - The **X axis** of the 2D shape controls the **radial distance** from the Z axis.
    ///   To move the shape outward from the center, translate it toward **positive X**.
    /// - The **Y axis** of the 2D shape maps directly to **vertical height** along the Z axis.
    ///
    /// The shape twists around the Z axis as it rises, forming a **right-handed** helix (counter-clockwise when viewed from above).
    /// To create a **left-handed** helix instead, flip the resulting 3D geometry along the X or Y axis after extrusion.
    ///
    /// If the 2D shape is centered at the origin, parts of it will lie directly on the Z axis.
    /// To avoid this, you typically want to move the 2D shape into positive X before extrusion.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - pitch: The vertical distance between each complete turn of the helix. Smaller values create tighter spirals.
    ///   - height: The total vertical distance the extrusion will cover along the Z axis.
    /// - Returns: A 3D geometry representing the 2D shape swept along the helical path.
