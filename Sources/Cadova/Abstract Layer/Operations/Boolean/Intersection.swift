/// A geometry type that represents the intersection (common overlap) of multiple shapes.
///
/// `Intersection` is a combined geometry type that takes multiple 2D or 3D shapes and returns their intersection â€“
/// the area or volume where all shapes overlap. The resulting intersection is defined based on the specific geometries
/// provided and can be useful for creating complex shapes from overlapping regions of simpler shapes.
///
/// ## Note
/// While you can use `Intersection` directly, it is generally more convenient to use the `.intersecting` method
/// available on `Geometry2D` and `Geometry3D`. The `.intersecting` method allows you to create intersections in a more
/// concise and readable way by chaining it directly to an existing geometry, making it the preferred approach in
/// most cases.
///
/// ## Examples
/// ### 2D Intersection
/// ```swift
/// Intersection {
///     Rectangle([10, 10])
///     Circle(diameter: 4)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### 3D Intersection
/// ```swift
/// Intersection {
///     Box([10, 10, 5])
///     Cylinder(diameter: 4, height: 3)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This will create an intersection where the box and cylinder overlap.
///
