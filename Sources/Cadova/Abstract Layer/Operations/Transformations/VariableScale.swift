public extension Geometry3D {
    /// Scales the geometry along a specified axis based on a user-defined scaling function.
    ///
    /// This method applies a non-uniform, dynamic scaling to the geometry by evaluating a closure
    /// that specifies how much to scale based on the position along the given axis.
    /// Only the existing vertices are transformed; no new points are inserted automatically.
    /// For best results, you should refine the geometry first if smoothness is important.
    ///
    /// The returned `Vector2D` specifies how the other two axes are scaled:
    /// - If scaling along `.x`, the `.y` and `.z` axes are scaled according to `Vector2D(x: ..., y: ...)`
    /// - If scaling along `.y`, the `.x` and `.z` axes are scaled
    /// - If scaling along `.z`, the `.x` and `.y` axes are scaled
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - axis: The axis along which the scaling function is evaluated.
    ///   - operationName: A descriptive name used for caching.
    ///   - params: Parameters that influence the scaling, used in the cache key.
    ///   - scale: A closure that returns a `Vector2D` representing the scale factors for the two other axes.
    /// - Returns: A new geometry with dynamic, per-point scaling applied.
    ///

    ///         refined(maxEdgeLength: 0.5)
    ///             .scaled(along: .z, operationName: "sinusoidallyScaled", cacheParameters: scaleRange, period) { z in
    ///                 let t = (sin(z * 360Â° / period) + 1) * 0.5
    ///                 let scale = scaleRange.lowerBound + t * (scaleRange.upperBound - scaleRange.lowerBound)
