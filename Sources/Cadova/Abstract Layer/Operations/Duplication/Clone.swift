    ///   transformation can include translations, rotations, scaling, or any custom modifications.
    /// - Returns: A new geometry that combines the original and the transformed clone.
    ///
    /// Example usage:
    /// ```swift
    /// let originalShape = Rectangle([10, 5])
    /// let compositeShape = originalShape.cloned { $0.rotated(45Â°) }
    /// ```
    /// In this example, `compositeShape` includes both the original rectangle and a version that has been translated
    /// 15 units along the x-axis.
