    /// rotated, only translated along the path.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - path: The Bezier path to follow.
    ///   - target: The optional direction or point to align the geometry with, controlling rotation around the
    ///             Z-axis. If `nil`, the geometry is only translated.
    ///   - reference: A local 2D direction in the XY-plane of the geometry used to resolve rotation when `target`
    ///                is specified. Defaults to `.down`.
