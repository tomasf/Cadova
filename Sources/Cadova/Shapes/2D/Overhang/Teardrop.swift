/// A teardrop shape used for 3D printing.
///
/// A teardrop shape is often used in place of a circle in 3D printing designs to reduce steep overhangs that are difficult to print.
/// By replacing circular geometry with a teardrop, the design becomes more suitable for printing, especially without the need for support structures.
/// The `bridged` style introduces bridging at the top of the originally intended circle, resulting in a shape that retains a more circular appearance while remaining printable.
///
/// If `Environment.naturalUpDirection` is set, the Teardrop will automatically rotate so that its point or bridge faces upward.
///
/// ```
/// // Example of creating a teardrop shape with a diameter of 10, angle of 30°, and full style.
/// let teardrop = Teardrop(diameter: 10, angle: 30°, style: .full)
/// ```
